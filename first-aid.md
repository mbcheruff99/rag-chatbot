# First Aid Basics Guide

Welcome to the First Aid Basics Guide! This guide covers essential first aid knowledge for common emergencies. Note: This guide is for educational purposes. Always seek professional medical help for serious injuries.

## First Aid Principles

Before providing first aid, remember these fundamental principles.

### The Three Ps

- **Preserve life:** Your first priority is keeping the victim alive.
- **Prevent deterioration:** Stop the condition from getting worse.
- **Promote recovery:** Help the healing process begin.

### Scene Safety

Before helping, ensure the scene is safe:
1. Look for dangers (traffic, fire, electrical hazards, unstable structures).
2. Don't become a victim yourself.
3. If unsafe, call for help and wait for professionals.
4. Move the victim only if staying poses greater danger.

### Calling for Help

**When to call 911:**
- Unconsciousness
- Difficulty breathing or no breathing
- Severe bleeding
- Suspected heart attack or stroke
- Severe allergic reaction
- Poisoning
- Severe burns
- Broken bones with visible deformity
- Any situation where you're unsure

**When calling 911:**
1. Stay calm and speak clearly.
2. State your location precisely.
3. Describe the emergency and number of victims.
4. Describe the victim's condition.
5. Stay on the line and follow instructions.
6. Don't hang up until told to do so.

### Consent

- For conscious adults, ask permission before providing first aid.
- For unconscious victims, consent is implied.
- For children, get parental consent if a parent is present.

## CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)

CPR can save the life of someone whose heart has stopped.

### When to Perform CPR

Perform CPR when someone:
- Is unresponsive (doesn't respond to tapping shoulders and shouting)
- Is not breathing or only gasping
- Has no pulse (if you're trained to check)

### Hands-Only CPR for Adults

If you're untrained or uncomfortable with rescue breaths, hands-only CPR is effective:

1. **Call 911** or have someone else call.
2. **Position the victim** on their back on a firm surface.
3. **Kneel beside them** at their chest level.
4. **Place the heel of one hand** on the center of the chest (on the breastbone, between the nipples).
5. **Place your other hand on top**, interlocking fingers.
6. **Position your shoulders** directly over your hands, arms straight.
7. **Push hard and fast:**
   - Compress at least 2 inches deep
   - Rate of 100-120 compressions per minute (rhythm of "Stayin' Alive")
   - Allow full chest recoil between compressions
8. **Continue until** help arrives, an AED is available, or the victim starts breathing.

### CPR with Rescue Breaths

If trained in full CPR:
1. After every 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths.
2. Tilt the head back, lift the chin.
3. Pinch the nose, create a seal over the mouth.
4. Give a breath lasting about 1 second; watch for chest rise.
5. Give a second breath.
6. Resume compressions immediately.

### Using an AED (Automated External Defibrillator)

AEDs are found in many public places and are designed for anyone to use.

1. **Turn on the AED** and follow voice prompts.
2. **Expose the chest** (remove clothing, dry if wet).
3. **Attach pads** as shown in the diagram (one on upper right chest, one on lower left side).
4. **Ensure no one is touching the victim** when the AED analyzes.
5. **If shock advised, clear everyone and press the shock button.**
6. **Resume CPR immediately after the shock.**
7. **Continue following AED prompts** until help arrives.

## Choking

Choking occurs when an object blocks the airway.

### Signs of Choking

- Inability to speak, cry, or cough
- Clutching the throat (universal choking sign)
- Blue lips or face
- Weak or ineffective cough
- High-pitched sounds or no sounds when breathing

### Helping a Conscious Adult

**Abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver):**
1. Stand behind the victim.
2. Wrap your arms around their waist.
3. Make a fist with one hand.
4. Place the thumb side of your fist above the navel, below the ribcage.
5. Grasp your fist with your other hand.
6. Give quick, upward thrusts.
7. Repeat until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious.

### Helping a Conscious Infant (Under 1 Year)

1. Place the infant face-down on your forearm, supporting the head.
2. Give 5 back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.
3. Turn the infant face-up on your other forearm.
4. Give 5 chest thrusts using two fingers on the center of the chest.
5. Repeat back blows and chest thrusts until the object comes out or the infant becomes unconscious.

### If the Person Becomes Unconscious

1. Lower them to the ground.
2. Call 911 if not already done.
3. Begin CPR.
4. Before giving breaths, look in the mouth for the object and remove if visible.

### If You're Choking Alone

1. Call 911 if possible.
2. Make a fist and place it above your navel.
3. Grasp it with your other hand.
4. Thrust inward and upward.
5. Or: Lean over a chair back or countertop edge and thrust your abdomen against it.

## Bleeding Control

Severe bleeding can be life-threatening within minutes.

### Controlling External Bleeding

1. **Apply direct pressure:**
   - Use a clean cloth, gauze, or your hand if necessary.
   - Press firmly on the wound.
   - Maintain constant pressure for at least 10 minutes.
   - Don't lift the cloth to check—add more material on top if needed.

2. **Elevate if possible:**
   - Raise the injured area above the heart if no fracture is suspected.

3. **Apply a pressure bandage:**
   - Once bleeding slows, wrap firmly with a bandage.
   - Check circulation below the bandage (warmth, color, sensation).

### When to Use a Tourniquet

Tourniquets are for life-threatening limb bleeding when direct pressure fails.

1. Place the tourniquet 2-3 inches above the wound (not on a joint).
2. Tighten until bleeding stops.
3. Note the time it was applied.
4. Do not remove—only medical professionals should do this.

### Nosebleeds

1. Sit upright and lean slightly forward (not back).
2. Pinch the soft part of the nose firmly.
3. Hold for 10-15 minutes without releasing.
4. Apply a cold compress to the bridge of the nose.
5. Seek medical help if bleeding continues after 20 minutes or if caused by injury.

### Internal Bleeding Signs

Internal bleeding is not visible but can be deadly:
- Bruising or swelling
- Pain, tenderness, or rigidity in the abdomen
- Vomiting blood (may look like coffee grounds)
- Blood in stool (black and tarry or bright red)
- Pale, cold, clammy skin
- Rapid pulse
- Confusion or disorientation

**Internal bleeding is a medical emergency. Call 911 immediately.**

## Burns

Burns are classified by depth and size.

### Types of Burns

- **First-degree (superficial):** Red, dry, painful. Only the outer skin is affected. Example: mild sunburn.
- **Second-degree (partial thickness):** Red, blistered, very painful. Affects outer and underlying skin.
- **Third-degree (full thickness):** White, brown, or black. May be painless due to nerve damage. Affects all skin layers.

### First Aid for Minor Burns

1. Cool the burn under cool (not cold) running water for 10-20 minutes.
2. Do not apply ice, butter, or toothpaste.
3. Remove jewelry or tight clothing near the burn before swelling.
4. Cover with a sterile, non-stick bandage.
5. Take over-the-counter pain medication if needed.
6. Do not break blisters.

### When Burns Need Emergency Care

Seek emergency care for:
- Burns covering large areas (larger than the victim's palm)
- Burns on the face, hands, feet, genitals, or joints
- Third-degree burns
- Burns that go all the way around a limb
- Chemical or electrical burns
- Burns in children or elderly
- Burns with smoke inhalation

### Chemical Burns

1. Brush off dry chemicals first.
2. Flush with large amounts of water for at least 20 minutes.
3. Remove contaminated clothing while flushing.
4. Do not try to neutralize the chemical.
5. Seek medical attention.

### Electrical Burns

1. Do not touch the victim if they're still in contact with the electrical source.
2. Turn off the power if possible.
3. Call 911—electrical injuries often have internal damage not visible.
4. Check for breathing and pulse; be prepared to perform CPR.

## Fractures and Sprains

### Recognizing a Fracture

Signs of a broken bone:
- Pain at the injury site
- Swelling and bruising
- Deformity (limb looks wrong)
- Inability to move or bear weight
- Grating sensation or sound
- Bone visible through the skin (open fracture—emergency!)

### First Aid for Fractures

1. Call 911 for severe fractures or if you can't safely transport the victim.
2. Keep the victim still; don't move the injured area.
3. Immobilize the injury in the position found (don't try to straighten).
4. Apply ice wrapped in cloth to reduce swelling.
5. Watch for shock (pale skin, rapid pulse, confusion).

**For open fractures:**
- Cover the wound with a clean bandage.
- Do not push exposed bone back in.
- Control bleeding with gentle pressure around (not on) the bone.

### RICE for Sprains

For minor sprains and strains:
- **Rest:** Stop using the injured area.
- **Ice:** Apply for 20 minutes every 2-3 hours.
- **Compression:** Wrap with an elastic bandage (not too tight).
- **Elevation:** Raise the injured area above heart level when possible.

Seek medical care if:
- You heard a pop at the time of injury
- You can't bear weight on the injured limb
- Swelling is severe
- Pain is severe
- The joint appears deformed

## Allergic Reactions

Allergic reactions range from mild to life-threatening.

### Mild Allergic Reactions

Symptoms:
- Itchy skin, hives, or rash
- Sneezing, runny nose
- Watery eyes
- Mild swelling

Treatment:
- Remove or avoid the allergen

- Apply hydrocortisone cream for skin reactions
- Monitor for worsening symptoms

### Anaphylaxis (Severe Allergic Reaction)

Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and requires immediate action.

Symptoms:
- Difficulty breathing, wheezing
- Swelling of throat, tongue, or face
- Rapid or weak pulse
- Dizziness or fainting
- Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
- Widespread hives
- Feeling of doom

**First aid for anaphylaxis:**
1. Call 911 immediately.
2. Ask if the person has an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen).
3. Help them use it:
   - Remove the safety cap.
   - Press firmly against the outer thigh (through clothing if needed).
   - Hold for 10 seconds.
4. Have them lie down with legs elevated (unless breathing is difficult).
5. Be prepared to give a second dose after 5-15 minutes if no improvement.
6. If they stop breathing, begin CPR.
7. Even if symptoms improve, they must go to the hospital.
